\section*{Instructions for authors}

A description on how to work with the repository can be found on \href{https://github.com/ahelm/my-favorite-physicist}{github}. Below you can find an example how to add one physicist you like to this document. You can use images or equations inside the document, but if you take some text from an online resource be so kind and provide where you have taken it from.

The directory structure is designed to reduce conflicts and create a better overview. The directory \texttt{/content} includes the different \texttt{.tex} files and you should add the corresponding \LaTeX\ files over there. Please store the images in the folder \texttt{content/figures}.
